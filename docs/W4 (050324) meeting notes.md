## TODO:
- Buddycheck Assignment: Give constructive feedback and follow the AED model. (due: 08/03/24)
- Checkstyle: Decide on checkstyle. (due: 08/03/2024)


## Workflow for this week:
- extend UI for the endpoints. (interaction)
- plan on how to implement language requirements


## Decisions:
- Catchup Meeting: Each week have a catchup meeting, possibly online on Friday evenings.
- Issue Distribution: Assign the issues earlier in the week to plan better.
- Weights: Use weights instead of time estimated.
- Priority: Use labels to prioritize issues.
- Closing Issues: Use 'closes #issue_number' in merge requests.

## Updates:
- Created endpoints and DTO's, database connection established.
- Implemented HTTP methods for each controller class to connect with the server.


## Q&A:
- Should we use weights or time estimated?
  > Both are fine.

## Other notes:
- start exploring mockito testing
- start using weights for issues
- start using milestones
- use labels more efficiently
- work on the frontend more
