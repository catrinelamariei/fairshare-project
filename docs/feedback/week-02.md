# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Feedback: Pass


#### Agenda 

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: 

> The agenda was added into the repository in time. The template was correctly followed and the individual points were clearly formulated.

> For next week, I would use some more whitespace to separate the topics a bit more.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: 

> The proposed topics were covered with the appropiate depth, but they were presented a bit out of order which made the meeting flow a bit confusing. Also, some topics were left out due to lack of time. I would suggest sticking to the order of the topics as much as possible, maybe even order them by importance so that the essential ideas are for sure tackled.

> Also, it's a good idea to include some time at the beginning for TA announcements.

#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback:

> You took ownership of the meeting as a team, which is great. The atmoshphere was constructive and respectful.

> I would like to see more involvement and enthusiasm during the meetings, especially hearing **all of you propose** ideas/topics instead of just answering questions. Consequently, the more "active" people should try to involve everybody in the discussion.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Excellent

Feedback:

> You presented the current state of the project, but not really in a structured way. For next week, please make sure that you take some time to show me the potentially shippable product. 

> As content itself, I liked that you went over the backlog together and prepared questions related to it. Also the flowchart was a nice addition, you're on a good track so far:).


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: 

> Again, try to be more structured next week and take some time to discuss what you did last week without me pushing you to do it. Also, maybe pay a bit more attention to non-coding assignments and make sure you're not neglecting them.

> Regarding your performance, the contribution seems more or less equal from all students so far, keep it up:).
