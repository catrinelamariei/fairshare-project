## Formative Assessment
*Grading scale: Insufficient - Sufficient - Good - Excellent*

#### 1) Self-organization - Good

I liked that by the end of the meeting, you really took control over the planning and discussed in depth how you are going to approach future deadlines. For next week, I would suggest for everybody to be engaged in the discussion and share their opinions, so please do not hesitate to say your viewpoint.

#### 2) Suggested Topics - Good

The suggested topics were mostly covered, especially the planning part. I would have liked to see some more discussion on the project itself, i.e., what features you like/don't like/are interested in implementing.
