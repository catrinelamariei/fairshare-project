# Meeting


#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass


#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback:

> The agenda was good and contained relevant topics, but it was definitely on the shorter side in terms of content. Also, it was not really uploaded on time (the updated version). Please make sure that you are uploading it correctly next week.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: 

> Great notes, the content was clear and contains all discussed topics. However, it doesn't really describe the agreements or tasks assigned to individual people. Please always add this in the meeting notes.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: 

> Good chair performance. You mostly covered all the topics, however you forgot the "announcements from the TA" bullet:). However, since the agenda was pretty short, your performance was indirectly affected since it finished like 15 minutes early.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: 

> You took ownership of the meeting, which is good. However, the whole discussion was a bit passive/monotone. I would like to see more enthusiasm regarding your progress and next steps for next week. 


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: 

> It seems you have good progress, however I would have liked to see some actual proof of it (e.g. Postman requests). 

> The application seems to contain a lot of enhancements in terms of backend, which is great. For next week, I would like you to have some updates on the frontend as well. This way, I can see the full working application more clearly.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Very Good

Feedback:

> You seem to have a good work distribution as far as I could tell. You reached your goals, which is great.
