# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization


Feedback: Pass


#### Agenda 

Feedback: Good

> The agenda was good in terms of content, but it did not follow the correct template. You should update the agenda in **Markdown**, not PDF format. Please use the correct format next week. 

> Also, please try to make more fixes estimates for the timestamps. Add estimates to the subtasks as well and avoid giving "time ranges" (10 to 15 minutes). 


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Feedback: Very Good

> The notes were added on time and contain a good amount of information, as well as concrete agreements, which is great. For next week, I would advise you to add the minutes directly into the agenda document, since it's a bit easier to follow in this way. Also, please write the notes in Markdown as well.

> Another point is to make the actual topics of the notes clearer and more connected to the actual points in the agenda.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback:

> Great chair performance throughout the meeting. You guided the meeting successfully and ensured the topics are covered. 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback:

> You took ownership of the meeting, which is great. You were all involved in the discussion and communicated your ideas.

> However, the athmosphere was a bit tensioned throughout some parts of the meeting. Please try to solve any potential conflicts in planning/coding/etc. early on, before they escalate, and try to be open minded regarding others' opinions.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Excellent

Feedback:

> Good progress in terms of the coding part. I like that you took your time to show me the scenes you built and also discussed about next steps. So far, you are on the right track to create a good working app until the project deadline.



#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Very Good

Feedback:

> So far, there seems to be a good and equal distribution of tasks within the team. I liked that you discussed clearly about your contributions from last week. I hope a more extensive planning will help with your blocking task problems.
