W2 (20/2/2024) meeting notes

TODO:
Short:
Ask on townsquare about language template				Due: today
Split flowchart work							Due: this week	
Knockout!!! (study guide) 						Due: this week
Decide on which DB to use						Due: preferably this week
Decide on unit testing framework					Due: preferably this week

Workflow for this week:
UI flowchart (payments part) & DB flowchart -> Classes -> DB -> GETs

Decisions:
Checkstyle: use default from OOP
Flowchart sketcher: benjamin
Currency: TBD, adjust DB later

Updates:
Started UI flowchart, in alternateflowchart branch (https://gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl/cse1105/2023-2024/teams/oopp-team-34/-/blob/alternateflowchart/docs/FlowChart.drawio?ref_type=heads)
Started DB flowchart, in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zM_k0aSH5gLYB6yuTCuXqQOTBuc5l5kF/view 
Mostly finished with git assignments


Q&A:
1. Language support: 
Live translate support Not needed, only static content
Language template live/restart server? Are the steps: add, restart server, then new template applies to everyone on server? TBD (ask on townsquare)
2. Server connection model
User doesnâ€™t directly communicate with DB (communicates with controller using MVC model)
Server is on localhost, not on browser
3. DB technology
Can choose own DB (traditional i.e. not key-value)
Configure DB in java
Testing: mockito

Other notes:
Ask questions related to project backlog in townsquare (mattermost) in the future 
Getters, setters, equals test cuz why not
