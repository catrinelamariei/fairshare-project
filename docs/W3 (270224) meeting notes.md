# W3 (27/02/2024) meeting notes

## TODO:
- Code of Conduct: write out due: 01/03/2024
- Checkstyle: OOP checkstyle due: 08/03/2024
- Extending UI: Implementing data submission due: 05/03/2024
- Server connectivity: endpoints and URLS due: 05/03/2024


## Workflow for this week:
- create COC
- start planning
- start on endpoints
- finish with UI

## Decisions:
- Code of conduct:  divide subjects so overyone has a few topics to write out
- Dividing work:    everyone needs to be involved in everything because otherwise, people might get too attached/ unable to understand code
- Handling MR:      
    - Make sure everything is approved/resolved before merging
    - Person who created MR should be the one to merge it, reviewer should only (dis)approve
- Bugs              found in merged code should be put in an issue and can be fixed by anyone
- Javadoc:          Optionally but not forced (eg. not for getters/setters), only for complex methods
- Invite code:      should be eventID (UUID)
- Objectives:       add all to gitlab so backlog becomes redundant and to get a clearer overview


## Updates:
- Started on database, transactions, adding an event to the database, tags, relations
- Started on UI: admin, login, events, home page


## Q&A:
- Who shoud merge?  
    > No impact in the evaluation tool git analysis

## Other notes:
- use blocking on issues
- Use weights on issues to divide work (graded)
- Use milestones
